# SQL-PROJECT
# HR Database SQL Project

This project demonstrates the use of SQL to query and manipulate a human resources (HR) database. It utilizes the classic HR schema, commonly used for learning SQL with MySQL.

## Project Structure

- `hr-schema-mysql-master/` – Contains the MySQL HR database schema and sample data.
- `ProjectSQL.sql` – Contains a set of SQL queries and operations performed on the HR database.

##  Features

- Employee and department analysis
- Aggregation and grouping (e.g., average salary by department)
- JOIN operations across multiple tables
- Subqueries and nested SELECTs
- Filtering, sorting, and reporting on employee data

##  Technologies Used

- MySQL (tested with MySQL 8+)
- SQL language features: `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, subqueries, etc.



### Prerequisites

- MySQL installed locally or on a server
- A SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver)

### Setup

1. **Load the HR schema:**
   - Unzip `hr-schema-mysql-master.zip`
   - Follow the README in that folder to create the HR database in MySQL

2. **Run project queries:**
   - Open `ProjectSQL.sql` in your SQL client
   - Execute each section to explore the data and insights

##  Example Queries

Some of the queries include:

- List of employees with their department names
- Departments with the highest average salary
- Employees who have been with the company the longest
